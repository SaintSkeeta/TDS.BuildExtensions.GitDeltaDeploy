Obsolete - this package has been moved to SaintSkeeta.TDS.BuildExtensions.GitDeltaDeploy.

If you have this package installed, it should have also installed the new 'SaintSkeeta.TDS.BuildExtensions.GitDeltaDeploy' package as a dependency.
Therefore you should be able to easily remove this package from your solution, using that new package instead.
